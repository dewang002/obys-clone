It is working fine but on mobile screen it is not scrolling down problem is being created by the plug in of gsap 
how I know because when I comment it out it start scrolling but I cant remove it because
most of the animation and timing function() and other stuff is done by gsap.
but when I scroll it on screen with responsive design it scroll there but with the help of mouse
FEEL FREE TO HELP ON THIS THING. other then that it was fun to design and learned a lot
